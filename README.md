# OTP_Verification
 The code for OTP verification using Python and Twilio API allows developers to implement two-factor authentication (2FA) in their applications. This provides an extra layer of security to the user login process by requiring a verification code in addition to the standard login credentials.

The code uses the Twilio API to send an SMS message containing a randomly generated verification code to the user's phone number. The user then enters this code into the application to complete the login process.

To generate the verification code, the random module is used to generate a random integer between 100000 and 999999. This code is then sent to the user's phone number using the Twilio API, which requires the user's account SID, authentication token, and Twilio phone number.

The user is prompted to enter the verification code received via SMS using the input function. The code entered by the user is compared with the generated code using an if statement. If the codes match, the user is logged in, and if they don't match, an error message is displayed, and the user is prompted to enter the code again.

This code provides a simple and effective way to implement 2FA in Python applications using the Twilio API, improving the security of user logins.
